# Village Notifier

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run start
```

## Configuration

You can edit the regular expressions that trigger notifications in `config.json`.  
You must define a `.env` file with your variables. There is an `.env.example` that you can copy.

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.13. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
